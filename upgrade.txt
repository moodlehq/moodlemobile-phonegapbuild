This files describes API changes in the Moodle Mobile app,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.1.1 ===

 * checkTime parameter was removed from the syncQuiz function in the mmaModQuizIndexCtrl controller. We don't check for time anymore.

=== 3.1.0 ===

 * A new param "single" is passed to the prefetch functions of handlers registered in $mmCoursePrefetchDelegateProvider. Please notice that the download of sections will always send false/undefined, if you use this function somewhere else to download a single module then you should pass single=true.
 * Activity modules have been moved from addons/mod_* to addons/mod/*.

=== 3.0 ===

 * The function $mmaModBook#getChapterContent now requires to receive the result of $mmaModBook#getContentsMap instead of module.contents.
 * The events obtained using $mmaMessages#getDiscussionEventName are deprecated. Now you should just use the event mmaMessagesNewMessageEvent and you will receive the site ID and user ID as parameters.
 * Directive "mm-browser" has been renamed to "mm-link" to be more coherent with its functionality.

=== 2.9 ===

 * Most of the functions from $mmaModScormOnline, $mmaModScormOffline, $mmaModScorm, $mmaModScormSync and $mmaModScormHelper now have a new param siteId to determine the site to affect. If you use any of these services please make sure you still pass the right parameters.
 * Now filepool tries to use the files names instead of just using a hash. If you used the functions "getFilePathByUrl" or "getDirectoryUrlByUrl" to store package files, you should now use "getPackageDirPathByUrl" and "getPackageDirUrlByUrl" instead.
 * A new directive "mm-state-class" has been created to allow a better customization of the app using remote CSS. You should add this directive to the ion-content in your views.

=== 2.8 ===

 * $mmModuleActionsDelegate has been renamed to $mmContentLinksDelegate to make it more generic. The specification of this delegate has changed, please look at its documentation to adapt your handlers.
 * State site.mm_course now requires a courseid parameter instead of course.
 * The parameters of the following $mmCoursePrefetchDelegate's functions have changed, now they also require a courseid: getDownloadSize, getModuleStatus, prefetchAll and getModulesStatus.

 * Fixed site URL is now supported via config.json. If you modified the code to use a fixed site URL we suggest you to remove the changes and add a property 'siteurl' to the config.json file instead.
